# learnings
A place to learn and save these learnings

Here's what I want to learn and the order I'll probably play around with them in this repo:  

 0. Git (forcing myself to only use command line for this repo, no GUI)  
 1. Docker  
 2. Use go again for the first time in 3 years  
 3. React  
 4. Some unmanaged code to learn more about GCs
